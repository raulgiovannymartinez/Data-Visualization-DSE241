Task 2 - Take screenshots of your original visualization from Exercise #1. Test them for three common color deficiencies using one of the websites provided here. Rectify any problems encountered by changing colormap.
Note: If your original visualization has a single color or simple line plots, create a visualization in Tableau with color and test it for color deficieny
Report - Up to 2 pages for individual work and up to 3 pages for group work (additional pages wonâ€™t be graded). Discuss how colormap changes affect the effectiveness of visualization. Use side by side (or up and down) images of before and after color deficiency correction in the report. Use multiple images as necessary. Refer to report format
